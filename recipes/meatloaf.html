    <h2>Chef John's Meatball-Inspired Meatloaf: An Oldie But A Goodie</h2>
    <p>This is chef John's famous meatloaf, inspired by his equally-famous meatball marinara dish. During the Great Depression, this type of dish was a popular method for creating a filling meal for your entire family using what little meat you had available.</p>
    
    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 onion diced onion</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>minced cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups very dry white bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground chuck</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>2 ounces grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>3 cups tomato sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil and butter together in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion with a pinch of salt in hot oil and butter until onion is golden brown and soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Place bread crumbs in a large bowl. Add milk and stir with a fork until combined. Let sit until all of the milk is absorbed into the breadcrumbs, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine ground chuck, cooled onion mixture, parsley, Parmesan cheese, eggs, 2 teaspoons salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Shape meat into a 3x4x10-inch meatloaf. Pour tomato sauce over the loaf and into the bottom of the dish.</li>
        <li>Bake until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Center should read at least 160 degrees. Let meatloaf rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
