        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>6 medium green bell peppers</li>
        <li>16 ounces tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>

        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F</li>

        <li>Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding the tops, seeds, and membranes. Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary to make sure they stand up straight.</li>
        <li>Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward.</li>
        <li>Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 1/2 of the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon an equal amount of filling into each hollowed pepper.</li>
        <li>Mix remaining tomato sauce and Italian seasoning in a bowl, and pour over the stuffed peppers.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour.</li>
